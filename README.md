# Perceptron
Just a simple perceptron using the sigmoid as an activation function in Julia

This repository consists of two files, one Pluto notebook named "Neural-networks.jl" and one raw julia file named "perceptron.jl".
It simulates a perceptron that is used to classify the MNIST database.
It uses backpropagation in order to calculate the gradient.
